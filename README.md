 x Use machine hostname for subdomain (with 'sdclibbery' prefix)
x Simple page that gets the pi CPU load, memory stats, heap status, disk space etc
x Authentication
* Force access via https only: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security
* Can run bot from a page
* And see logs as it runs
* Page that lists running bots with status and progress

Need bots to be reentrant - ie able to restart without losing state - for this:
* Active bot list
